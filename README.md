# Datasets en Confusion Matrix Assignment
For this assignment I've worked with the mushroom.csv file to see if a mushroom is indeed edible or poisonous. The DecisionTree made this all possible.

# Things I haven't fixed
- In a separate html file called model-loader.html I've loaded in the JSON but I didn't made an UI basically for the reason I couldn't make this user friendly with the mushroom data. If I had chosen the titanic dataset it would be easier to make users predict if person x survived the titanic. Because I need the semantic labels and p en e doesn't make sense at all for the user.
